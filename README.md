## Overview

**Fachero**, is a Facebook Messenger for Lion OSX, it uses the jabber protocol to communicate with facebook and it has a beatifull and simple design. I can't give the client a lot of attention right now due to other projects I'm working on. That's why it's open sourced. If users start to using it, We (Federico and I) we'll give it some love.

When you try it, make sure to use your facebook vanity name as your "username". Do not use your facebook username. You can check your vanity name (or set one) using this page: <https://www.facebook.com/username/>

## Themes

Chat window could be customized by HTML. Right now, it is using the theme located in: "Resources/Message Styles/minimal_mod.FaceChatMessageStyle/" but eventually it will be load autmatically all themes in that folder.

## Requirements

 * OSX > 10.7.x is required since I'm using CellViews and other new things.

## Art Resources

All art resources are inside a PSD file made by Federico Abad, and it's available for everyone. I didn't add it into the repository because is heavy. I'll upload it soon.
